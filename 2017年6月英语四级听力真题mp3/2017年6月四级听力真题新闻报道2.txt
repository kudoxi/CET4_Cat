Thousands of bees left a town after landing on the back of a car when their queen got stuck in its boot.
Tom Moses who works at a nearby national park,noticed a "brown patch" on the back of the car after the owner parked it to do some shopping.
When he looked closer, he realized it was a hugegroup of bees.
Moses said: "I have never seen that many bees in one spot. It was very unusual.
They were very close together and there was a lot of noise and movements.
It was interesting to see such a strange sight.
But there were a lot of people around and I was a bit worried about the bees and the people stopping to look.
I thought that someone might do something stupid."
Moses called two local bees specialists who helped removed the bees by attracting them into a box.
Moses spent three hours looking after the bees and was stung five times.
He said, "My stings are a bit painful but I am pleased that all worked out and I could help.
People need to realize that bees are valuable and they should be looked after."
