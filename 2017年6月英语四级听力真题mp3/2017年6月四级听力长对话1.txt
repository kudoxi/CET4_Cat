    W: Did you enjoy your stay with us, Mr. Brown?
　　M: Yes, very much. I had a wonderful time here.
　　   Now I'm going to the airport. My flight leaves in less than 2 hours.
　　   So, could you tell me, what's the quickest way to get there?
　　W: Well, we can call a taxi for you.We also have a free airport shuttle service.
　　M: That sounds great, but will the shuttle get me to the airport in time?
　　W: Yes, it should. The next shuttle leaves in 15 minutes.
　　   And it takes some 25 minutes to get to the airport.
　　M: Fantastic! I'll just wait in the lobby. Will you please let me know when it's leaving?
　　W: Of course, sir.
　　M: Now I would like to settle my mini-bar bill. How much is that?
　　W: Let's see. It comes to $37.50. How would you like to pay for it?
　　M: I'll pay with my credit card. Thanks.
　　	But I'll need a receipt, so I can charge it to my company.
　　W: Absolutely! Here you are, sir. If you like, I can leave your bags with the porter.
　　	And he can load them onto the shuttle for you when it arrives.
　　M: That would be great. Thank you.
　　W: Would you like to leave a comment on our web page when you have time?
　　M: Sure. I had a really good stay here, and I'd like to recommend your hotel to my friends and colleagues.
　　W: That's very kind of you. Thank you again for staying at Sheraton Hotel.
